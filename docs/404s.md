# Why do I see 404s?

404 errors are fine during development.  Rave crawls your project's metadata
during development to auto-configure itself.  At times, Rave doesn't find an
expected metadata file.

## Can I eliminate these 404s?

In most cases, yes.  However, it's not typically necessary to eliminate
these 404 errors during development.  If you really want to make them
go away, here's what you can do:

1.  Add a `data-rave-meta` element to the `<html>` element.  You can tell
    rave which package manager metadata to crawl by setting a value on
    `data-rave-meta`.  For instance, to only crawl for `package.json`
    files, do this: `<html data-rave-meta="package.json">`.
2.  Ensure that there are `bower.json` files in you Bower-managed dependencies.
    Bower allows authors to publish packages without `bower.json`,
    unfortunately.  If `bower.json` is missing for one of your favorite
    third-party packages, you should bug the author to add it!
