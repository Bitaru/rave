# RaveJS

## What is RaveJS?

RaveJS is next-generation modular architecture, today.  RaveJS
is designed on EcmaScript and *de facto* standards.  It's open and
is designed to integrate with *everything*.

## Do I need a PhD in Computer Science to use RaveJS?

No.  If you can do `npm install` or `bower install` and if you can add
a single script element to an HTML page, you can master RaveJS!

## How do I start?

Check out the [Quick Start using Bower](./docs/quick-start-bower.md)
and the [Quick Start using NPM](./docs/quick-start-npm.md).
