# RaveJS

## What is RaveJS?

RaveJS is next-generation modular architecture, today.  RaveJS
is designed on EcmaScript and *de facto* standards.  It's open and
is designed to integrate with *everything*.

## Does RaveJS require a PhD in Rocket Science?

No.  If you can do `npm install` or `bower install` and if you can add
a single script element to an HTML page, you can master RaveJS!

RaveJS is the easiest way to get started with modules.  Author AMD, CommonJS,
or (soon) ES6 modules without transpiling, build steps, or secret
incantations.

## Does it scale?

Yes. RaveJS easily scales to applications containing hundreds of modules
from dozens of third-party packages.  It doesn't matter if those packages
are available on NPM or Bower -- or whether they're authored in AMD, CommonJS,
or (soon) ES6 format.  RaveJS makes it all work seamlessly.

## Is it extensible?

Very. RaveJS extensions allow third-parties to provide new capabilities
to RaveJS or your application.  Install extensions easily through NPM
(`npm install --save <name-of-rave-extension>`) or Bower
(`bower install --save <name-of-rave-extension>`).

RaveJS extensions are easy to create and easy to find on NPM and
Bower by searching for "rave-extension" (available soon).
